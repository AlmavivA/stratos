# Load balancer test configuration 1

# cep-stats-publisher-enabled = true
#

loadbalancer {

    # Default load balancing algorithm
    # Refer algorithm name from algorithms section.

    # given cluster if the selected member fails to respond.

    # the topology configuration accordingly. If not static configuration given in the services
    # section will be used.

    # dedicated load balancers for services.
